# 👋 Hey, I'm Preston

I’m a senior full stack engineer. Most of my professional work has been around building and deploying **React** front ends and **Node.js** services, and working with the teams handling the broader microservices that connect to them.  

Along the way I’ve gotten very deep into **Grafana** and **BigQuery**, since monitoring our services and digging through the data when things go wrong.

Lately I’ve been pushing myself outside of the pure web stack and getting more serious with **Python**. I’ve started building and deploying some small ML-backed APIs to round out my skills and get comfortable with where the industry is heading.

## 🔧 What I Work With
- **Full Stack**: React, Node.js, Express, GraphQL/REST  
- **Cloud & Deployment**: Docker, Cloud Foundry, Terraform-managed environments  
- **Observability & Data**: Grafana, BigQuery  
- **Learning**: Python, FastAPI, scikit-learn

## 📌 Some of My Work
- [**nba-predictor**](https://github.com/preston-bernstein/nba-predictor) — 🏀 End-to-end NBA predictor: scrapes Basketball-Reference → builds rolling features → trains scikit-learn → serves via FastAPI (/predict). Reproducible Makefile pipeline, strong pytest/HTML coverage, pre-commit + CI (branch/diff-cover). Currently a clean logistic-regression baseline, extensible.  
- *More to come*: I plan to share some Grafana dashboards and an NBA prediction project I’m working on as I clean them up
